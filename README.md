# Project_Panneau_RAM
Here are my pieces of software that I developed for my Panneau_RAM project. There was two systems:  two water basin and a cooking system.

First, we would control the level water in the basin using a PID. Then, we would control the tempeture of the water. We could read the power of system with a powermeter. 
Second, we would control a cooking system. It had three buckets of different kinds of material. We would control motors to poure the quantity wanted material and mesuring it with a scale. Then, ones of procress is completed, a vacuum would sock it back into the bucket with the least material.
